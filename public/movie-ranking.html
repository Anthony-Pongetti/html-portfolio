<h1>The Best Movies According to Anthony</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>This is my favourite of all times.  It has the best plot to follow 
    as well as character development.</p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>It was hard deciding between this and my top movie since I believe 
    they both have amazing character development.</p>
<h3>The Outpost</h3>
<p>This movie is very funny and I absolutly love how realisticly it 
    portrays the US military.</p>
